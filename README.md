# Gasly

This is a sample project. It allows an employee to login to dashboard via email and view gas meter readings of specific clients.

## What you'll need

Not much anything. The project is deployed on [Vercel](https://gasly.vercel.app)
A sign up will be generated via email for first time login.

## Viewing the data

Select a client from the menu on the right. 
The card on the right will show the total daily gas consumption based on all meter readings collected. The middle card shows the total daily consumption of individual readers. The graph visualizes the gas consumption of the last 24 hours.
